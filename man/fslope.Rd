\usage{
fslope(y, smooth = TRUE, thres = 0.22, width = 5, tr = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{is a waveform with only intensities.}

\item{smooth}{is tell whether you want to smooth the waveform to reduce the effect of some obvious noise. Default is TRUE.}

\item{thres}{is to determine if the detected peak is the real peak whose intensity should be higher than threshold*maximum intensity. Default is 0.22.}

\item{width}{width of moving window.Default is 3, must be integer between 1 and n.This parameter ONLY works when the smooth is TRUE.}

\item{tr}{the temporal resolution of waveform.Default is 1 ns. Must be integer from 1 to n.}
}
\value{
return the front slope angle (FS, The angle from waveform beginning to the first peak which is assumed to be canopy returns)
  and roughness of outermost canopy (ROUGH, the distnace from the waveform beginning to the first peak).
}
\description{
The function allows you calculate the (1) front slope angle (FS, the angle from waveform beginning to the first peak
which is assumed to be canopy returns) and (2)roughness of outermost canopy (ROUGH, the distnace from the waveform beginning to the first peak).

\examples{

###for the one peak, this function returns not useful results.
#This function more related to vegetation and canopy.

#default
yr<-fslope(y)

yy<-return[182,]
yyr<-fslope(yy)
