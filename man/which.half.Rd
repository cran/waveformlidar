\alias{which.half}
\title{which.half}
\usage{
which.half(x, rescale = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{is the waveform intensities. If you have other information, you should delete these intensites before you run this function.}

\item{rescale}{is to determine whether you want to rescale the waveform intensity or not. Here we used the minimum intensity of each waveform to conduct rescaling.
Default is using rescaling.}
}
\value{
return the index of half total energy position of waveform.
}
\description{
The function allows you to identify the half total energy position (time location) which can be used to calculate the height from waveform ending or waveform begining.
}
\examples{

data(return)
x<-return[1,]
#default
which.half(x)
#NOT USE rescale, the result will be a bit different
half_pos <- which.half(x,rescale=FALSE)
##the distnace from half position to the waveform ending is
dis_end = (wavelen(x)-half_pos)*0.15
dis_begin = half_pos*0.15 ##here 0.15 is the 1ns distance.
