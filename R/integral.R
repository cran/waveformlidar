#' integral
#'
#' The function allows you to calculate the integral of intensity from ground part, vegetation part, sum of them
#' and ratio between vegation integral and total integral with user-defined vegetation and ground boundary.
#'
#' @param y is the waveform intensities. If you have other information, you should delete these intensites before you run this function .
#' @param smooth is tell whether you want to smooth the waveform to reduce the effect of some obvious noise. Default is TRUE.
#' @param thres is to determine if the detected peak is the real peak whose intensity should be higher than threshold*maximum intensity.
#'        Default is 0.2.
#' @param rescale is to determine whether you want to rescale the waveform intensity or not. Here we used the minimum intensity of each waveform to conduct rescaling.
#'        Default is using rescaling.
#' @param width width of moving window.Default is 3, must be integer between 1 and n.This parameter ONLY work when the smooth is TRUE.
#' @param tr the temporal resolution of waveform.Default is 1 ns. Must be integer from 1 to n.
#' @param dis the distance from last echo (assumed ground) which determine the boundary between ground and vegetation.
#'        Default is 20 ns which equals to 3 m (20*0.15*1).This means the ground part signals are from
#'        the assumed ground location to 20 ns above or the signals of vegetation are from waveform begining to 3 m above ground.
#' @return return the integral of waveform intensity for the ground, vegetation parts, the whole waveform above ground
#'        and the integral ration betwwen vegetation and the whole waveform .
